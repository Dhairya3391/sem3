        ParagraphParagraphs are the group of sentences combined together, about a certain topic. It is a very important
        form of writing as we write almost everything in paragraphs, be it an answer, essay, story, emails, etc. We can
        say that a well-structured paragraph is the essence of good writing. The purposes of the paragraph are to give
        information, to explain something, to tell a story, and to convince someone that our idea is right.
